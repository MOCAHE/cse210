# Jumper
Try to guess a random word, if you do the game is over, but for every time you miss, a part of the jumper will disappear.

## Getting Started
---
Make sure you have Python 3.10.6 or newer installed and running on your machine. Open a terminal and 
browse to the project's root folder. Start the program by running the following command.
```
python jumper
```
You can also run the program from an IDE like Visual Studio Code. Start your IDE and open the 
project folder. Select the main module inside the dice folder and click the "run" button..

## Project Structure

The project files and folders are organized as follows:
```
root                    (project root folder)
